We started implementing the json serializing and deserializing in on our own, and we have it is almost working, but there are some hard to solve bugs. To get rid of these we will reimplement the serde and deser and rely much more on the fileaccess package given to us from the professor. We had problems getting up and running with our classes, because they differ a bit in architecture from the one the professor supplies, but we have almost solved that, so in a approximately a week we will have the serializing perfected.

For now much of the state works when serializing and deserializing, but when we want to deserialize the board from json the the subclasses of `Space` gets lost and all subtypes gets turned into generic Spaces, which makes the board not very useful. Unfortunatly we will not have time to fix this for the delivery on 5th of May, but it is almost completed and will be done as soon as possible.
