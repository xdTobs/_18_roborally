## Could have

- 37 - start a timer in the activation phase of 30 seconds, when i am done programming, so that the other players run out of time, and gets random programming cards on their empty programming fields. this is easier to implement online than it is to do with one computer

## Would be nice to have

    - take two spam damage cards and place them in my discard pile,
    - cancel my programming
    - discard my programming cards (including damage cards) from register and hand
